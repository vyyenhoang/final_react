The Final
--------------

Objective:
  To demonstrate your understanding of React within the context of a React/Express application.

NOTE:
  The ENTIRE server side and User/Session portion of this app have already been completed. You are to ONLY work within the following files within the client/src/components directory:
  - Routes.jsx
  - shared/Nav.jsx
  - tours/Index.jsx
  - tours/New.jsx
  - tours/Edit.jsx

Tasks:
  1) Create a component to handle creating new Tours
  2) Create a component that allows you edit existing Tours
  3) Create an index page that displays all the registered Tours and provides
     the link to edit the tours and the ability to delete the tours
  4) Add the appropriate routes to navigate to each of the components using
     React Router
  5) Add a link to the Tours and New Tour pages inside the navigation. The link
     must only appear if the user is logged in

Rubric:
  ~ -20% for non-working application in Heroku
  ~ -10% if the app isn't in Github
  ~ -10% for each task that is incomplete or not working (-50% in total)
  ~ -5% for each syntax error, reference to past
    labs/assignments/projects/blog, or code ugliness (please run through
    a beautifier) (Maximum loss is -30%)
